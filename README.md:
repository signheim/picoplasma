# JOYLEDPAINT
Raspberry Pi Pico Joystick 8x8 WS2812 Paint App

Needs pico_ws2812b library by @benevpi (https://github.com/benevpi):
https://github.com/benevpi/pico_python_ws2812b

How it works
------------
Simple paint app for a 64 pixel 8x8 led matrix
with one-button control of all functions.

Move the joystick to color LED pixels with
a chosen color. Switch color by pressing the
button. Cycle through several colors
(including a delete mode). Press the button
long enough to erase the screen and start
new.

Code preparations
-----------------
Install the pico_ws2812b library by @benevpi by
saving it to the pico (i.e. with Thonny) and name
it 'ws2812b.py'.

Also save the 'joyledpaint.py' as 'main.py'
to the pico to enable it without computer
connection.

# picoplasma
Plasma Generator for Raspberry Pi Pico with Pimoroni Unicorn Pack

Based mainly on two great contributions about the plasma-effect
https://www.bidouille.org/prog/plasma
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Plasma_effect#Python

How it works
------------
Power up the Pi Pico with the Pimoroni Unicorn Pack installed.
Plasma will immediately start on the LED matrix.

Press A to cycle through 3 speeds
Press B to hold the animation
Press C to switch polychrome and monochrome
Press D to cycle through 3 color modes

Enjoy!

Code preparations
-----------------
To get access to Pimoronis product specific librarys the Pi Pico
needs to be flashed with a Package from Pimoroni that has
the usual MicroPython on board plus the librarys for the
Unicorn Pack and other stuff from Pimoroni.

Save the 'picoplasma.py' as 'main.py'
to the Pico to enable it without computer
connection.

Parts
-----
  - Raspberry Pi Pico
  - Pimoroni Unicorn Pack (https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-unicorn-pack)

Wiring
------
The Pimoroni Unicorn Pack is designed for a direct connection with the Pi Pico.
If the Pico has pins soldered the usual way the Pack fits on it's back and is
wired automatically.

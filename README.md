https://www.bidouille.org/prog/plasma
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Plasma_effect#Python

How it works

Code preparations
-----------------
To get access to Pimoronis product specific librarys the Pi Pico
needs to be flashed with a Package from Pimoroni that has
the usual MicroPython on board plus the librarys for the
Unicorn Pack and other stuff from Pimoroni.

Save the 'picoplasma.py' as 'main.py'
to the Pico to enable it without computer
connection.

# PICOPLASMA WITH MESSAGE
Plasma Generator with scrolling for Raspberry Pi Pico with Pimoroni Unicorn Pack

Based mainly on two great contributions about the plasma-effect:
  - https://www.bidouille.org/prog/plasma
  - https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Plasma_effect#Python

About the framebuffering I found a way in with the hekp of this project:
  - https://github.com/harveysandiego/raspberry_pi_pico_micropython

How it works
------------
Power up the Pi Pico with the Pimoroni Unicorn Pack installed.
The animated plasma-effect will immediately start on the LED matrix.

  - Press A to cycle through 4 speeds: slow, medium, fast, stop, ...
  - Press B to change the color scheme
  - Press X to toggle the scrolling message on and off
  - Press Y to switch between a number of messages

Enjoy!

Code preparations
-----------------
To get access to Pimoronis product specific librarys the Pi Pico
needs to be flashed with a Package from Pimoroni that has
the usual MicroPython on board plus the librarys for the
Unicorn Pack and other stuff from Pimoroni.

Save the 'picoplasma-message.py' as 'main.py'
to the Pico to enable it without computer
connection.

The Pimoroni Unicorn Pack is designed for a direct connection with the Pi Pico.
If the Pico has pins soldered the usual way the Pack fits on it's back and is
wired automatically.
